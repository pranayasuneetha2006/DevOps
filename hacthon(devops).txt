1. Devops Introductiom
 What is DevOps?
  DeOps= Development + Operations 
It's a culture+set of practices+tools that help:
 > Developers(who write code)
 > Operations( who deploy/manage systems)
* Work together,instead of working in silos.

Real time example:
 imagine You're Building a mobile app like SWIGGY:
  . The developer writes code to add " Track My Order" Feature.
  . Without Devops: Developer gives code to Ops team-ther manually-deploy-bugs happen-delays.
  . With DevOps: Code is automatically tested and deployes-Customers get updates faster and safely.

DevOps Helps You:
. Release features faster ( like adding new payment methods in Zomato)
. Fix bugs quickly (like fixing login issue in IRTC)
. Automate repetitive  tasks(like server restarts, database backups)
